# PicoLibrary-Class

## Forked from jitsengupta/PicoLibrary as a sub-library to be used for the System Design course

### Original repo will still be recommended for students, but installing only this in the picos

A collection of classes around the Raspberry Pi Pico Hardware interface to make it easy to 
work with Lights (LEDs, RGB LEDs), Sound (active and passive buzzers), Displays, buttons and a 
basic implementation of a state model forcreating simple state machines.

Currently supported hardware - (more to be added)

* Buttons - both pulled-down and pulled-up buttons supported
* Buzzers - both active and passive buzzers supported
* LEDs - Basic LEDs (on/off) and Dimmable LEDs (setting brightness level)
* Composite lights - TrafficLight (red, yellow, green), Pixel (R, G, B)
* Neopixel Lightstrips
* Displays - 160x displays (both I2C as well has GPIO)
* Sensors - both ditigal (0/1) as well as Analog (ADC 16 bit) sensors
* Specialized Sensors - Ultrasonic Sensor, Temp sensor, DHT11/DHT12 temp/hum sensor and Tilt sensor

Contact Dr. Sengupta if you need support for any other hardware
